## Current Research Directions

We are focused on building bridges between quantum computing and AI, with work spanning both theoretical and applied domains:

- **Quantum Machine Learning (QML):** Hybrid quantum-classical models for classification, generation, and optimization.
- **Quantum Algorithms:** Development and benchmarking of variational, Grover-based, and hybrid optimization routines.
- **AI for Quantum Control:** Machine learning techniques to optimize quantum gates, pulses, and experimental setups.
- **Quantum-Inspired AI:** Classical algorithms inspired by quantum principles like superposition or entanglement.

## Featured Research Spotlight

### *“Quantum Neural State Tomography with Attention-Based Circuits”* (2025)

- **Authors:** Zhao, L., Martinez, A., & Narang, P.
- **Published in:** *Nature Quantum Information* (May 2025)
- **Citation count:** 432+
- **Summary:**  
  This influential paper proposes an attention-based variational quantum circuit architecture for reconstructing quantum states from sparse measurements. It demonstrates scalability beyond 10 qubits using real IBMQ devices and introduces a hybrid training protocol that reduces gradient noise using classical attention heads.
