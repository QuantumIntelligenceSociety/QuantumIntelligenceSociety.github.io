> Here is our vision.  
SQAI is the world's premiere international **academic + business** conference in **quantum + AI**.  
We lead a future of universal quantum utility where AI runs natively on quantum hardware.  
> (1) Merge quantum and AI.  
> (2) Merge academia and industry.  
> (3) Unite QAI research initiatives between the United States, Taiwan, and the world.

As the boundaries between quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and interdisciplinary systems continue to blur, SQAI 2026 provides a unique academic and business platform to explore breakthroughs at the intersection of these transformative technologies. The conference will spotlight the most pressing challenges and visionary advances shaping the future of computation and cognition.

SQAI 2026 will feature a rich lineup of keynote speeches, technical presentations, demos, poster sessions, and panel discussions.  
We will also have a business exhibition.

We will offer researchers, engineers, and government a vibrant space to share insights, collaborate across domains, and chart new directions in quantum-enhanced AI research.

We are honored to host SQAI 2026 in the dynamic and culturally rich cities of Taipei and DC. We look forward to your contributions and to advancing the frontier of Quantum AI - together.
