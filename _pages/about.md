Welcome from the Chairs of SQAI 2026
===
It is with great pleasure that we welcome you to the 3rd Symposium for Quantum AI (SQAI), to be held on June 26-27, 2026, in two locations: Taipei and Washington D.C.

📍 Taipei and Washington D.C. | 🗓️ June 26-27, 2026

> SQAI’s mission is to democratize artificial intelligence through quantum technologies while enhancing public understanding of quantum science. We unite researchers and professionals across AI, quantum computing, and quantum AI to foster cross-disciplinary innovation. By building bridges between Taiwan, the United States, and the global tech ecosystem, we aim to drive impactful collaboration and progress.

As the boundaries between quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and interdisciplinary systems continue to blur, SQAI 2026 provides a unique platform to explore breakthroughs at the intersection of these transformative technologies. From quantum-enhanced learning algorithms to ethical design in intelligent systems, the conference will spotlight the most pressing challenges and visionary advances shaping the future of computation and cognition.

SQAI 2026 will feature a rich lineup of keynote speeches, technical presentations, workshops, demos, and panel discussions, offering researchers, engineers, and practitioners a vibrant space to share insights, collaborate across domains, and chart new directions in AI and quantum research.

This year's conference emphasizes cross-disciplinary innovation, drawing participants from academia, industry, policy, and the open-source community. Our single-track format ensures that every presentation gets the spotlight it deserves and every attendee can engage deeply with the full spectrum of ideas presented.

We are honored to host SQAI 2026 in the dynamic and culturally rich city of Taipei. We look forward to your contributions and to advancing the frontier of Quantum AI—together.
