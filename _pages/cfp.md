*Source: [quantum.gov](https://www.quantum.gov/quantum-image-gallery/) – QSA researchers work on the E8 experiment using ultracold atoms to study novel quantum phases of matter.*

## Overview

We invite submissions of **original research papers, demos, and workshop proposals** in all areas related to **Quantum Artificial Intelligence**, including but not limited to:

- Quantum machine learning and algorithms  
- Quantum-enhanced optimization  
- Quantum data science  
- Hybrid quantum-classical systems  
- Applications of Quantum AI in science and industry  
- Ethical and societal implications of Quantum AI  
- Interdisciplinary or speculative approaches  

Whether you're working on fundamental theory, practical applications, or novel frameworks that rethink the relationship between quantum computing and intelligent systems, we want to hear from you.

## What is Quantum AI?

**Quantum AI** is the emerging field at the intersection of **quantum computing** and **artificial intelligence**, where quantum algorithms and hardware are leveraged to enhance the way intelligent systems learn, reason, and process information.

Quantum AI explores:
- Optimization and search  
- Generative models and pattern recognition  
- Quantum-enhanced reinforcement learning  
- Cryptography and secure multi-agent coordination  
- AI for quantum control and error correction  

It is more than just a technical fusion—it is a reimagination of how intelligence and computation may co-evolve in the quantum era.

## Submission Guidelines

- Submissions must be **original** and **not under review elsewhere**.
- Papers should follow the official [conference template](#) and be submitted via [EasyChair / Submission Portal](#).
- All accepted contributions will be presented at the conference and included in the proceedings.

We welcome theoretical, applied, and exploratory contributions. Both short papers and long papers will be considered.
